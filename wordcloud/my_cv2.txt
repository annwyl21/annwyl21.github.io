 My word cloud was generated using text scraped from this page and the evolved flip-image showcases my rapid skill development. I have created Docker images and successfully contributed to the Docker repository. I have organised myself using a github project to create a 'career development plan' to manage my projects using pull request and issues features. Additionally, I broadened my scope by completing an online course focused on meta-prompts, which resulted in my AI project. My symptom logger uses AI to summarize medical symptoms logged to an app, showcasing my ability to apply and adapt my knowledge of MySql to meet new challenges and connect to a PostgreSQL database using a docker image. My journey has also led me to city-based coding meetups, where I've begun to build a vibrant and supportive network and joined a weekly coding club focusing on Test Driven Development. July 2023 - September 2023 This bootcamp hosted by Just IT covers fundamentals of web and software development and offers career advice to support my transition into tech. For my individual mid-term tech bootcamp project, I developed 'BrewQueue', a to-do list tool for baristas to manage coffee orders, using JavaScript. I used local storage to give my tool persistence, adjusted the code to systematically deplete the queue, and used the browser debugger to catch a missing variable declaration�a scenario that would result in a reference error in Python but which had been gracefully handled by JavaScript. As I transition into the next phase, I'm preparing to delve deeper into SQL and Python. Jan 2023- April 2023 This evening course offered an introduction into programming covering Agile, Python, JavaScript, Git/ Github, MySQL, Postman, CSS, HTML and finished with our final group project, a flask site to make debt repayment calculations. Our site also had some data visualisation using matplotlib and pandas, and some testing with pytest and a github workflow. During the course I had free access to additional online training resources and took advantage of this opportunity to independently complete Fundamentals training including Linux Command Line and Serverless/ Cloud computing along with Information Security & Risk Management(laws, regulation & compliance), CyberSecurity and an Introduction to GDPR. The course used Miro boards, Mimeo notes, Webex, and Zoom to engage 16 participants. In the final group project, I developed an online financial calculator. Using GitHub Projects, we effectively managed our team's progress and ensured project success. 2009-2023 Over the past decade, I've navigated personal challenges while dedicating my time to raising and caring for my family. Simultaneously, I taught myself coding, delved into comprehensive literature on the subject, and executed various coding projects, showcasing my resilience and commitment to continuous learning. 2005-2009 After gaining my qualification and certification to practice legally in the UK, I worked for 2 central London healthcare trusts, across clinics, hospitals and primary schools. I managed a large caseload, worked directly with patients, clinicians and parents to provide therapy targeting communication skills and trained teaching staff to support children with communication needs. 2002-2003 Speech & Language Therapy Assistant 1999-2002 Sales & Marketing, Insightful (Statistical Software) 1998-1999 Sales, Multex (Financial Research) 1997-1998 American Express Business Travel Booker City University 2003-2005 Pg Dip in Speech & Language Therapy University of Greenwich 1994-1997 BSc (Hons) PsychologyPython JavaScript HTML CSS SQL Regex MySQL PostgreSQL Git Docker Gitbash Ubuntu �Github Github workflow �Dockerhub Pytest Pextract Jest Flask Matplotlib Pandas NumPy NLTK Bootstrap Beautiful Soup Visual Studio Code (VSCode) PyCharm Jupyter Notebook Postman Azure Cognitive API AI Prompt Engineering py, js, html, css, sql regex Flask, Bootstrap, pytest, Pextract, BS4, Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy, NLTK MySQL, PostgreSQL Git, Gitbash, Ubuntu�Github, Github workflow, Docker, �Dockerhub VSCode, PyCharm, ipynb Postman, Azure Cognitive API, AI Prompt Engineering
