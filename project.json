		"info": "Initially designed to contain the logic to score an individual dice roll during a game and return an object with the score possibilities, this scorer also now allows a user to play the game against the computer, tracking the score in a scoreboard object.This project demonstrates my understanding of object-oriented programming, ability to code the scoring logic required for yahtzee and the commit history in github will show that I built this project using Test Driven Development - writing the tests before writing the code. For this project I used GitHub workflows, initiating automatic unit tests to continuously ensure the quality of my code.",
		"detail": "I used pytest and Pexpect for unit testing, the debugger tool to identify errors swiftly and an Agile GitHub Project board to efficiently manage tasks and break objectives into manageable chunks. This helped me to keeping the project on track and deliver my goals.",

A bubbleplot illustrates the frequency of symptoms over time and throughout the day, with bubble size signifying reported pain levels.",
