                <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
                    <p>I am a hardworking and enthusiastic individual who has <span>proactively acquired new skills</span> in programming while balancing family life. I am a good team player and enjoy <span>working with others to deliver</span> a common goal. I am a confident communicator and have excellent interpersonal skills. I am able to work well on my own initiative and when I developed a passion for coding, I dedicated time to <span>teach myself</span> JavaScript and Python through various online platforms and self-study materials.</p>
    
                    <p>Inspired by my newfound interest in coding, I sought more formalized training through the highly-competitive Get into Tech <span>Bootcamp</span>, a 15-week course. Here, I delved deeper into Python and learned about more technologies. During the course, I continued my autodidactic approach to learning and took advantage of additional learning opportunities that became available with access to a wide range of additional, non-compulsory resources. I experimented with Pytest and github workflows, and <span>completed various extra courses</span> including Linux Command Line Fundamentals, Serverless/ Cloud computing along with Information Security & Risk Management(laws, regulation & compliance),CyberSecurity and finally an Introduction to GDPR.</p>

                    <p>Informed by my previous career in healthcare, I possess a unique perspective and a strong grounding in communication and accessibility. As I transition to a career in technology, I am looking for my first opportunity as a <span>junior software developer</span> where I can grow my abilities.</p>

                <p>This bootcamp hosted by QA Ltd offered an introduction into programming covering <b>Agile, Python, JavaScript, Git/ Github, MySQL, Postman, CSS, HTML</b> and finished with our final group project, a <b>flask site</b> to make debt repayment calculations. Our site also had some data visualisation using <b>matplotlib</b> and <b>pandas</b>, and some testing with <b>pytest</b> and a <b>github workflow</b>.</p>
                <p>During the course I had free access to additional online training resources and took advantage of this opportunity to <span>independently complete</span> Fundamentals training including Linux Command Line and Serverless/ Cloud computing along with Information Security & Risk Management(laws, regulation & compliance), CyberSecurity and an Introduction to GDPR.</p>
                <p>The course used Miro boards, Mimeo notes, Webex, and Zoom to engage 16 participants. In the final group project, I developed an online financial calculator. Using GitHub Projects, we effectively managed our team's progress and ensured project success.</p>
